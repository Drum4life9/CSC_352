Things to do:

1) Number of visits
2) Dates all before May 1st
3) Foreign distances, maybe from middle of country?
4) Create a list of campus interests
5) Any primary student ids that are blank and students that have not been accepted
6) Count number of communications, earliest date
7) FAFSA early is a good sign
8) Money columns:
    Total cost of attendance
    What the FAFSA thought that their family could afford
